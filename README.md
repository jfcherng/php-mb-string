A high performance multibyte sting implementation for frequently reading/writing operations.


## Why I Write This Package?

Consider that you have a **LONG** multibyte string and 
you want to do lots of following operations on it.

- Random reading/writing such as `$char = $str[5];` or `$str[5] = 'è¨±';`.
- Replacement such as `str_replace($search, $replace, $str);`.
- Insertion such as `substr_replace($insert, $str, $position, 0);`.
- Get substring such as `substr($str, $start, $length);`.

Because strings in PHP are not UTF-8, to do operations above safely,
you have to either use `mb_*()` functions or calculate the index by yourself.
Using `mb_*()` functions frequently could be a performance loss because it has
to do string decoding basing on the given encoding every time. The longer the
string is, the severer the problem becomes.

Instead, this class internally stores the string in a UTF-32 form.
UTF-32 is fixed-width (1 char always occupies 4 bytes) so we are able to
perform speedy random accesses. With the power of random access, we could
use `str_*()` functions to do the job internally.


## Installation
